### **1. Cloud Security with AWS IAM**

This project provides a guide on using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to implement cloud security best practices.

* **Project Goal:** To learn and apply key concepts of AWS IAM, including access control, group-based permissions, and resource restrictions.
* **Technologies Used:** The services used were AWS EC2 instances, IAM Policies, IAM Users and User Groups, and AWS Account Alias.
* **Key Concepts:** This document explains how AWS IAM is used for access control and group-based permissions. It also covers how to use resource restrictions to control access to specific EC2 instances and the importance of AWS Account Aliases for simplified login. The project involved creating and testing an IAM policy to ensure it worked successfully during the testing phase.
